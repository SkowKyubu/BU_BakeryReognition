# Bakery recognition by neural network
The objective of my internship was to develop an autonomous artificial intelligence capable of effectively scanning and processing customer orders, thereby facilitating a self-sustained payment service tailored to the needs of local bakeries in Bangkok. I proceeded with several steps, encompassing a comprehensive understanding of neural networks and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the establishment of a robust database, training of the AI using data, and the creation of a user-friendly application and integrated device for the final solution. This report presents a detailed account of the entire development process, including the theoretical foundations, practical challenges encountered, methodologies employed, until the realization of the project's purpose.
